"""Given three input values representing counts of nickels, dimes, and quarters, output the total amount as dollars and cents.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point using the following statement:
print(f'Amount: ${dollars:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

3
1
4

where 3 is the number of nickels (at $0.05 each), 1 is the number of dimes (at $0.10 each), and 4 is the number of quarters (at $0.25 each), the output is:

Amount: $1.25

For simplicity, assume input is non-negative.

# Calculate total
total = nickels * 0.05 + dimes * 0.10 + quarters * 0.25
